# broken-space
Broken space is a story driven-sandbox-adventure game set in space, the universe is procedurally generated similarely to no mans sky, but including an actual storyline(wink wink). Every item, quest, planet, ore, creature, ship, star, everything, is procedurally generated, and even better? The game will run on any computer running a 32 bit windows operating system.
